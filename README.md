# AI-TruthScan: Detect AI-Generated Interview Responses

AI-TruthScan is a web application that allows users to analyze audio and video recordings to determine whether the responses are likely generated by AI or created by humans. The application uses Google Gemini for AI analysis and integrates speech recognition for transcription.

The primary objective is to assist recruiters and HR professionals in verifying the authenticity 
of candidates' responses, ensuring fair and reliable hiring decisions.

## Features
- Record audio and video or upload existing files for analysis.
- Transcribe audio using speech recognition.
- Analyze transcriptions using AI models to classify them as "Real (Human-Created)" or "Fake (AI-Generated)".
- Gaze tracking to assess whether the speaker is reading from a script.
- Provides real-time analysis and confidence scores. 
- Store and retrieve analysis results from a SQLite database.  
- User-friendly UI for seamless interaction. 
- Detailed insights on response authenticity. 
- Can be integrated with existing HR tools.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Flask
- **Database**: SQLite
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini
- **Audio Processing**: SpeechRecognition, SoundDevice, Wavio
- **Video Processing**: OpenCV, FFmpeg

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-TruthScan.git
cd AI-TruthScan
```

### Install Dependencies
You need to install the required packages for both the frontend and backend.

1. Frontend (Streamlit) Navigate to the frontend directory and install the required packages:

```bash
cd frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Backend (Flask) Navigate to the backend directory and install the required packages:

```bash
cd ../backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set Up Google API Key
Replace the placeholder 'api_key' in 'backend.py' with your actual Google API key.

## **Usage**

### Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python backend.py
```

### Running the Frontend

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd AI-TruthScan/frontend
```

3. Run the Streamlit application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Accessing the Application
Open your web browser and go to 'http://localhost:8501' to access the Streamlit application.

## **API Endpoints**
### Analyze File
